# ft_printf withou malloc

In this version of ft_printf, I coded without allocating memory with malloc. The execution speed of this version of ft_printf is about three times as fast as the version with malloc. It is almost as fast as the original printf.

### What I learned

My [first version](https://github.com/gokily/ft_printf) could not pass the automated tests in order to validate the project. So I decided to recode it from scratch and make it more efficient. I challenged myself to make a version of printf that did not allocate memory. You can read more about it in [this blogpost](https://gokily.com/blog/2019/04/06/that-time-I-had-to-rewrite-all-my-code/).
